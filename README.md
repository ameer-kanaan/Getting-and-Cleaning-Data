# Getting and Cleaning Data


This is the README file for run_analysis.R

Merely running this script will give you an output of tidy.txt

The run_analysis.R does the following:
* Takes the same variables mentioned in README(Old).txt and turns them into a more R friendly and tidy version. Variable names get converted into an alphanumeric form without any special characters.
* Produces an output "tidy.txt" whose variables are described in the Codebook
